# Servers

The **Servers** page lists the machines your models run on. **Local** is the Argos container itself. Add the others over SSH, the same way you do in Odysseus.

Profiles launch on the **default** server (★). **Local** runs the `llama-server` path set on it, or `llama-server` on the `PATH` when it is blank.

## Added by setup.sh

`setup/setup.sh` records where llama.cpp runs (`ARGOS_SETUP_MODE` in `.env`), and Argos fills Servers in from it each time it starts:

| Mode | Servers |
| --- | --- |
| **1** llama.cpp inside Argos | **Local** runs the image's `llama-server` (the official images keep it at `/app/llama-server`). |
| **2** llama.cpp next to Argos | **Local** runs `/app/bin/docker-llama rocm` (or `cuda`): one container per model from the image you picked. |
| **3** your own llama.cpp containers | One server per container (`llama.cpp ROCm`, `llama.cpp CUDA`), with the mounted key as its key. Added only once the key is mounted at `/run/secrets/argos_ssh_key`; until then the Logs page says so. |

Edit Local or a setup server on this page and your edit wins: setup no longer changes it.

## Add a server

1. Click **Add server**. Enter a name, `user@host` and the SSH port. Pick a colour if you like.
2. Optional: an environment that is activated first on that machine (**venv** with its path, or **conda** with the env name), the path to `llama-server` if it is not on the `PATH`, and the **Model Directory** folders. The ◉ marks the folder downloads go to.
3. **Save**, then click **Key** and **Generate key**. Argos makes a key pair for this server and shows one command. Run it once in a terminal that can already log in to the server. It adds Argos' public key to that server's `authorized_keys`.
4. Click **Check**.

Check connects, runs a short script that only reads, and shows:

- the time it took to connect
- where `llama-server` is, and whether vLLM, SGLang and Docker are installed
- the GPU stack (`rocm` or `cuda`) and card names
- whether the server **sees the same model files Argos sees**: it lists the `.gguf` files in the server's Model Directory folders and compares them with Argos' own models folder by file name and size. It tells you which files are missing there, which differ in size, and which folders do not exist. If the llama-server container does not mount the same models folder, this is where you find out.

If a Check fails, the reason is shown on the card, for example `Connection refused` or `Permission denied (publickey)`. Permission denied means the key command has not been run on that server yet.

Argos keeps each private key in its own `ssh` folder (`ARGOS_SSH_DIR`). It never leaves the container. **New key** in the key window replaces it.

## Set servers up before starting

Put the servers in a file and point Argos at it:

```yaml
# servers.yaml
servers:
  - name: llamacpp
    host: root@mx-llamacpp-ssh
    port: 22
    llama_server: /app/llama-server
    gpu: rocm
    model_dirs: [/app/models]
    default: true
  - name: cuda-box
    host: root@llama-cuda
    gpu: cuda
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
services:
  argos:
    environment:
      - ARGOS_SERVERS_FILE=/app/config.d/servers.yaml
```

`ARGOS_SERVERS` takes the same list as JSON.

- The file adds servers when Argos starts. You still make each key on the page.
- A server from the file follows the file on every start.
- Once you edit a server on the page, it belongs to you and the file no longer changes it.

## Import from Odysseus

**Import from Odysseus** copies the servers your Odysseus Cookbook already knows. It needs the Odysseus URL and token in **Settings**. Entries without an SSH host, such as Odysseus' own Local, are skipped.

Odysseus' keys stay in Odysseus, so each imported server needs its own key from Argos. Click **Make key** and run the command, then **Check**.

## Requirements

- The Argos image has `ssh` and `ssh-keygen`. The Dockerfile installs `openssh-client` if the base image lacks it.
- The server runs sshd and accepts key login.
- Argos and the server are on a Docker network that can reach each other, if the server is another container.
